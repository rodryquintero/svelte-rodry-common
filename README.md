 Many Svelte components that I commonly use

 ## Pre-requisites
 These components are designed to be used with the following packages
 - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
 - [Fontawesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/v5.9.0/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use) 
 
 Make sure your project has these installed.

 ## Components
  ### Modal

  Very simple modal window using Tailwind css classes.
