# svelte-rodry-common
 Many Svelte components that I commonly use. Some are built by me and others are modified version of existing components to be used with Svelte.

 ![Svelte Logo](https://svelte.dev/svelte-logo-horizontal.svg)

 ## Pre-requisites
 These components are designed to be used with the following packages
 - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
 - [Fontawesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/v5.9.0/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use) 
 
 Make sure your project has these installed.

 ## Components
  ### Modal

  Very simple modal window using Tailwind css classes.
  ### Tabs
  Recompiled version of `svelte-tabs` with the latest version of Svelte. This fixes an error related to the older Svelte version used by the package.

  _Coming soon..._

  ### Tabulator
  Sveltified version of `tabulator-tables`.

  _Coming soon..._

  ### Treeview
  Based on the Treeview examples shown in several REPLs. It uses *Fontawesome* icons
